        <h2>About_Me</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Owiye Vincent is a soccer and Rugby player from Kenya.
                I was born to the third wife of MY father, a railway attendant, and into a family of 16 children where I am the lastborn.
                I grew up in Siaya where I attended lower primary before moving to Nairobi to where I graduated with a primary and secondary school Certificate. 
                I began playing soccer and rugby at a young age at <strong><em>Sadili Oval Academy</em></strong>.</p>
            <p>I was born in Ugenya, Siaya District (now Siaya County).
                Vincent ventured into playing sports immediately after completing primary school.
                It was a difficult decision because sports was not paying  in Kenya and it is not considered as a career.
                However, with determination I could not be stopped by the societal view of Sports and  pursued my talents and interests.
                After a long struggle, my soccer friends and I joined kenya's division one league side <strong><em>Ligi Ndogo</em></strong>
                soccer academy after high school where I  played as a goalkeeper.</p>
            <p>Some of the most popular clubs I played for are "Nyahururu Yanga FC (Laikipia County)", "Umoja FC (Baringo county)", "Egerton FC (Nakuru county)",
                "Nyahuruu All-stars (Laikipia county)" "Strathmore University Fc" and "Riara University FC" among others.
                I played as first choice in most of the teams I played for and second choice to some teams.</p>
            <p>In my football career I have toured almost all counties just by the name of playing football.
                Only months before giving sports a rest in 2021,
                I won a schoolarship to join school where am learning website and software development at <strong><em>Moringa School</em></strong> .</p>
