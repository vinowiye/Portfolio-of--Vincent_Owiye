                Vincent ventured into playing sports immediately after completing primary school.
                It was a difficult decision because sports was not paying  in Kenya and it is not considered as a career.

                "Nyahuruu All-stars (Laikipia county)" "Strathmore University Fc" and "Riara University FC".
                He played as first choice in most of the teams he played for and second choice to some teams.</p>
            <p>In his career he has toured almost all counties just by the name of playing football.
                Only months before giving sports a rest in 2021,
